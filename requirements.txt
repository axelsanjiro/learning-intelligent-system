# --- Core Data Science & Math ---
numpy           # The foundation of all matrix math
pandas          # Data manipulation (DataFrames)
matplotlib      # Basic plotting
seaborn         # Prettier statistical plotting

# --- Machine Learning (Classic) ---
scikit-learn    # The gold standard for ML algorithms (Regression, SVM, etc.)
scipy           # Scientific computing (used by scikit-learn)

# --- Computer Vision ---
opencv-python   # The main CV library (cv2)
Pillow          # Image processing helper (PIL)

# --- NLP (Natural Language Processing) ---
nltk            # Classic NLP library (tokenization, stemming)
spacy           # Industrial-strength NLP (faster, cleaner API)
gensim          # Topic modeling and Word2Vec
transformers    # Hugging Face (State-of-the-art models like BERT/GPT) - Optional but likely needed later

# --- Deep Learning (The Engine for CV & NLP) ---
# PyTorch is currently more popular for research/students.
torch           
torchvision     # Datasets and models for Computer Vision
torchaudio      # Audio handling

# --- Utilities ---
tqdm            # Progress bars (Essential for long training loops)
jupyter         # To run .ipynb notebooks
notebook        # The classic notebook interface
scikit-image    # Image processing algorithms
